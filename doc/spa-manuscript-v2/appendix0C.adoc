When we prepare our SPA for distribution we want to ensure it
passes numerous quality checks, does not disclose any proprietary
information, is easily deployed and rolled-back as needed.
Here is the checklist we follow:

- Is the source fully reproducible including patched vendor libraries?
- Does the app pass ESLint checks?
- Have TODO notes been reviewed?
- Does the app pass regression tests?
- Does test coverage exceed minimum thresholds?
- Has the app been committed to the repository?
- Are only the assets required to serve the application present?
- Have all personally recognizable data been removed from the site?
- Have all SCMS metadata been removed from the build?
- Is the content full compressed and obfuscated?
- Has a commit been associated with the build number?
- Has a build number been assigned to this distribution?
- Can we rollback to an earlier build if there is a problem?
- Have planned for a rollback so that we do not polute or corrupt
  the data the application is using?
- Do we monitor the application to ensure availability?
- Is the deployment resiliant to individual system failures?
