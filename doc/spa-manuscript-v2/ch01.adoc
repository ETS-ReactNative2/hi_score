This book is an Engineer's guide on how to create large-scale Single Page
Applications (SPAs) and manage them throughout their life cycle. We use
JavaScript (JS)footnoteref:[JS,We use JS and JavaScript interchangeably
throughout this book] as the preferred language for as much of the stack as
possible -- in the Browser, on server, and in development tools. This second
edition includes five substantial changes which we hope you will find exciting
and useful.

1. Unless otherwise noted, all software presented is designed and tested to
work well within a full product lifecycle. We discuss life cycle stages such
as planning a software stack, installing a development environment, managing
vendor libraries, linting, testing, code coverage, building, release
management, and monitoring. Almost every life cycle stage has been automated,
and all configurations are placed in the `package.json` file.

2. Code examples have been substantially future-proofed through the use of NPM
packages and explicit software version pointers.

3. Many examples have been updated to show ES2015 (ES6) implementations.

4. We have expanded some examples to illustrate the use of currently popular
tools such as Vue.JS and React. We also provide more concrete guidance for
selecting a library or framework.

5. The development environment is presented as a virtual appliance. This
removes almost all the drudgery and error out of creating a development
environment. In just a few minutes readers can run examples exactly as
presented in the book without any platform-specific issues.

== Audience
This book is intended for web developers, dev-ops, architects, and product
managers with at least a smattering of JS, HTML, and CSS experience. If you've
never even dabbled in web development, this book is not for you. Many books
are available that do a great job teaching beginner website development and
design. This isn't one of them. Of course you're welcome to buy it anyway (go
ahead, Daddy still needs a new car).

About two-thirds of this book is devoted to client development. The last third
shows how to build a server using Node.js. If you're locked in to another
server platform, most of the logic should be easy to translate.

This is a *Concept book*. We show examples using plain JS, jQuery, React,
Vue.js but our goal is to identify the universal concepts required by a
successful SPA so the reader may apply them as old libraries fade and new ones
gain popularity. If you want something more targeted you may be better served
by a *Survey* or *Toolkit* book as described in the sidebar.

.SIDEBAR: What is a "Concept book?"
****
There are three broad categories of technology books.

- A *Concept book* covers a broad range of issues and show general purpose
  solutions. Readers buy concept books with the hope of gaining general
  purpose, long-lived expertise. Consider this type of book an "Engineer's
  guide."
- A *Survey book* covers a narrower range of concepts but compares ready-made
  solutions. A Survey SPA book reviews a number of toolkits and judges how
  well they support a required concept used by an SPA. Consider this type of
  book a "Buyer's guide."
- A *Toolkit book* is designed for a specific toolkit and is usually purchased
  after someone has made a significant investment in a toolkit and needs to
  learn how to use it. Consider this type of book an "Owner's manual."

Each type of book has its purpose and audience. This is a *Concept book*.

== Building an SPA
Let's create a Single Page web Application (SPA). First we will prepare a
development environment as presented in Appendix A and shown in Figure 1.1.

.Figure 1.1 -- Development appliance
image:ch01/appliance-02.png[VirtualBox appliance,1112,577]

Then we can build and inspect an example SPA as shown in Listing 1.1.

.Listing 1.1
[source,bash]
----
  cd ~/Github/my_repo && bin/xhi dev_start,build \
  && google-chrome http://localhost:8080/build/latest/dist/app-tb02.html
----

The example application is the typing tutor game Typebomb2.  This is the SPA
we will build and improve in this book.

.Figure 1.2 -- Typebomb2
image:ch01/tb2-src-001.png[VirtualBox appliance,1336,797]

Now that we've built an SPA let's define what it is.

== What is an SPA?
An SPA is an application that uses the web browser as its execution
environment. It relies on the browser resources instead of the underlying OS
to operate. This provides much of the same promise of "write once, run
anywhere" as Java desktop applications.

Traditional client-server web applications use the server for processing and
the browser is little more than a glorified dumb terminal. With SPAs, data and
logic that used to live on the web server now reside in the user's browser. A
comparison is shown in Figure 1.2.

.Figure 1.2 -- Traditional web app vs. SPA
image:ch01/spavstrad-02.png[Tradition vs. SPA,800,470]

SPAs are written in JS and deployed to billions of devices across the world.
Numerous high-profile applications have moved from OS-specific implementations
to SPAs in recent years. Examples include much of the Microsoft
https://products.office.com/en-us[Office suite] and
https://quickbooks.intuit.com/[Quickbooks Online]. Other recent applications
have skipped OS-platform implementations altogether. Examples include
https://gsuite.google.com/[Google docs] (AKA "GSuite") and numerous ChromeOS
applications. And finally, some popular apps that _appear_ to be OS-specific
implementations are just SPAs wrapped in an
https://electron.atom.io/[Electron] or http://cordova.apache.org/[Cordova]
container. Examples include https://slack.com/[Slack] or
https://linkedin.com[LinkedIn] mobile and desktop applications.

== Successful SPAs
We've worked on some fairly successful SPAs and a few duds (hey, nobody's
perfect). One might say a successful SPA is well-liked, reliable, and meets
the sponsor's business objectives. All SPAs we considered successful had the
 following characteristics:

- Good product vision
- Lifecycle management
- A rationalized software stack
- Feature module ("web component") architecture

We discuss each of the characteristics briefly below and we review them in
greater depth in subsequent chapters.

=== Good product vision
The best SPAs exceed expectations and surprise-and-delight stakeholders thanks
to careful research and design prior to launch. The following living documents
should be developed along with the product:

- A Long Term Vision [LTV] plan which includes customer roles, team language,
  and big picture plans for a product 3-5 years into the future.
- A Minimal Viable Product [MVP] plan which is used to guide development of
  the initial release.
- Case studies and mockups for key user work-flows.
- A plan for identifying and monitoring Key Performance Indicators [KPIs].

Authoring these documents requires research. A good place to start is to
survey all stakeholders (engineers, sales, support, end users, systems, and
customers) to identify the key product characteristics required for success.
A little research often yields surprising results.

Desirable product traits often include fast load times, a responsive UI,
secure and private data, support for mobile devices, stability, ease-of-use,
and Search Engine Optimization. What is most important will vary by product
and may not be in the list above.

=== Lifecycle management
An application that works great in a demo but can't be used as intended or
supported by customer service is not much use to the sponsor. We need to
design our product with an eye on the typical product lifecycle as shown in
Table 1.1.

=== A rationalized software stack
We've noticed an inverse relationship between the number of Domain Specific
Languages [DLSs] and the likelihood of a product's success.  DSLs are
introduced whenever we include a new library, framework, system tool, or
language.

All SPAs need to accomplish many of the same tasks using the same concepts.
Those who master these concepts can better select appropriate tools for their
product.

We talk a bit rationalizing language use in the link:why_javascript[Why
JavaScript] section and we  discuss the full software stack in Chapter 3.  The
key point is we use a tool only if its benefit clearly outweighs its cost.

=== Web components
SPAs tend to evolve into a feature-module (or "web component") architecture as
shown in Figure 1.3. This design pattern has been adopted by popular libraries
such as React and Vue.js because it embraces the fractal MVC nature of an SPA.

.Figure 1.3 -- Feature-module architecture
image:ch01/architecture.png[Feature-module architecture,800,475]

[[why_javascript]]
== Why JavaScript?
In a perfect world we would use JavaScript as our only language as shown in
Figure 1.4.

.Figure 1.4 -- JavaScript end-to-end
image:ch01/end-to-end.png[JavaScript everywhere?,800,230]

We don't love JavaScript (although perhaps we've grown a bit fond), and this
is not a religion. But because JS is the _only_ universal browser control
language it is the _one_ language that _must_ be mastered. As a consequence
when everything else is equal, we prefer to use a tool written in JS over one
written in another in a different language. This improves our process and our
product in the following ways:

- Time-to-market is reduced because the amount of study required to plan,
  develop, test, and support an app is reduced.
- Nimbleness and productivity is enhanced as developers can work across roles
  such as database, middleware, TCP server, or browser environments with
  minimal "context switching" cognitive overhead.
- Quality is improved and time-to-market is reduced by using *isomorphic*
  libraries across roles.

Of course there are limits to this approach. Developers must still know DOM
structure and markup languages like HTML, CSS, and SVG. And sometimes we need
to use a process or a Bash script that isn't written in JavaScript, or use an
SQL database to get the job done. And that's OK because real artists ship.

Let's see what we can acheive if we rationalize our software stack.  Figure
1.5 shows a potpourri of languages used to develop and manage an SPA.  This
stack is typical of an "organic growth" organization.

.Figure 1.5 -- Software stack over-diversity
image:ch01/lang-01.png[Language potpourri,800,225]

If we instead rationalize the software stack to minimize the number of Domain
Specific Languages [DSLs] used to create and manage an SPA _throughout its
lifecycle_ we can simplify this significantly as shown in Figure 1.6.

.Figure 1.6 -- A rationalized software stack
image:ch01/lang-02.png[Rationalized,800,225]

We show examples using plain JS, jQuery, React, and Vue.js but we don't
recommend including all these libraries into a single product. Instead we want
to consider the requirements before selecting a tool.

.What JavaScript version will be using?
****
Some tools we rely on don't yet work with ES2015. As of Fall 2017, somewhere
between http://gs.statcounter.com/browser-market-share[10] to
http://gs.statcounter.com/browser-market-share[30]% of all browsers in use
don't support ES2015. Neither does the excellent
http://lisperator.net/uglifyjs/[uglify-js] compressor. One popular option to
get around these problems is to use a transplier such as
https://babeljs.io/[Babel] or
https://github.com/google/traceur-compiler[Traceur]. However, doing so
provides a number of challenges:

1. They don't work particularly well as we can see in this
https://kangax.github.io/compat-table/es6/[handy chart] from the helpful folks
at Kangax. Look under the Babel, Traceur, and Typescript columns to see how
many of the advanced features we really want simply fail when transpiled.  So
until all major tools and browsers are ES2015 compliant we are back to
debugging ES5.1.

2. If we transpile, ES2015 code will require compile step before we can use or
test it. This overhead will occur with any change and can significantly
increase iteration timefootnoteref:[iterations,Iteration time is the time it
takes to try a solution to a problem. Shorter iteration times result in
better solutions sooner.].

3. Debugging the source code becomes more challenging both during development
and after release. This is further complicated by bugs or omissions in the
transpiler itself (see point 1). This again increases iteration times.

Transpiling isn't just for limited ECMAScript. We can tack on a transpiler for
static type checking using https://flow.org/[Flow] or
https://www.typescriptlang.org/[Typescript] and this is indeed a
http://ttendency.cs.ucl.ac.uk/projects/type_study[noble purpose]. But is it
worth the cost? Or can we get the same benefits using a simple code standard
and typecasting?

Despite all the features we'd love to use from ES2015 and Flow, adding
multiple steps the the development, debugging, deployment, and support for
each transpile introduces substantial overhead and instability. We'd rather
embrace KISSfootnoteref:[KISS,Keep It Simple Stupid] principles and use
simple practices to provide similar benefits at a much lower cost.

For all these reasons we've kept JS 5.1, at least for now. We present ES2015
(ES6) syntax where it is relevant and hope to upgrade to this standard before
final publication. We identify any ES2015+ code as shown in Figure 1.7. The
preferred version title is always at the top, and alternatives names are
shown in parenthesis.

.Figure 1.7 -- ECMAScript versions

== When SPAs make sense -- and when they don't
SPA are an excellent solution when we need an app that responds like a
traditional desktop or smartphone application. They are also an excellent
choice for applications that must run across multiple operating systems.

SPAs are usually are not a good solution for publishing of blogs or other
sites where the primary action a user takes is to view content using standard
browser controls. Twitter, for example, famously decided to change publishing
tweets with a simple static page to a clever SPA. Within 18 months they
https://blog.twitter.com/engineering/en_us/a/2012/improving-performance-on-twittercom.html[reverted
to static rendering]. A little study of their customers would have shown them
that initial render time and SEO were critical factors in success of their
platform. And an SPA wasn't going to beat a static page on those metrics using
the technology of the time.

Sometimes it's not clear whether a traditional web application or an SPA is
better. Instead of emulating Twitter, we suggest building mockups and testing
with focus groups to gauge the relative costs and benefits of an SPA. The
answer usually becomes obvious quickly.

== Summary

.SIDEBAR: Answers to "Do you know?"
****
[quanda]
What types of apps work best as SPAs?::
Answer: Interactive tools where responsiveness is highly valued are good
choices for SPAs. Apps that must run across multiple operating systems are
another good choice. Apps that mostly present content may be better served by
a more traditional client-server web application.

What is the benefit of preferring JS tools?::
Answer: Generally the fewer domain specific languages (DSLs) a developer or
team has to master the better the product because DSL mastery is expensive to
attain and maintain. Additional challenges with DSLs include context
switching, translation errors, and lack of nimbleness. For example, a
developer may be constrained to only a few types of jobs because they have
limited ability to learn all the DSLs in use.

What are some stages of the SPA product lifecycle?::
Answer: The top stages are Design, Development, and Deployment.  There are
around 22 stages under these top categories.
****

- SPAs are applications that use a web browser as the execution environment
  and usually are cross-platform.
- It is wise to plan for every stage of an SPAs life cycle.
- We rationalize and simplify the software stack to reduce training and
  iteration times; encourage shared code; reduce time-to-market; and improve
  testing, quality, and support.
- SPAs are a great approach for many applications, but they aren't *always*
  the best choice, especially for relatively static content where search
  engine optimization is important.
